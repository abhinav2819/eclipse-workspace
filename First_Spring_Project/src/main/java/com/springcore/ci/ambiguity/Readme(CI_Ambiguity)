Ambigutiy Problem in Constructor Injection
	As we can see in Emp.java class that we have instansiated two attributes of integer type, one is x and one is y
	and also we created the three different types of constructors having different parameter inside
	the parameter feid for first we use int-int type which was default as per our instansiated 
	attributes, in second we use double-double and in last String-String asa well as i created a 
	method which adds the both two integer as doSum .
	When we created a bean and injected trhough construction injection after that i created a main
	class which ask the getbean method from the created application context method and also we call the 
	doSum method which adds both the attributes.
	When we run the java application we got to know that the String-String parameter constructor type was 
	called by the bean,
	when we commented the String-String parameter constructor and again run the application we got to know
	that the first constructor was called by the bean mean by using the order from the starting of the calss
	i also checked by reversing orders of the constructors also (Other than String-String) and the result
	was same the first constructor was calling,
												so this is the ambiguity problem there in the constructor
	injection.
	
Solution :
			i) Use index attribute -> index="0"
			ii) Use type attributr -> type="int"
			iii) Use name attribute -> name="x"
